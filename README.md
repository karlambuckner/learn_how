# _LearnHow_

#### _A web application for hosting events providing people the opportunity to learn something exciting and new. Capstone independent project for Epicodus. Dec 21, 2017_

#### By _**Karla Buckner**_

## Description

_Our events range from learning how to code, to making fresh pasta from scratch, to budgeting and everything in between. We believe learning alongside fellow neighbors creates a sense of community and camaraderie. We find that learning by observation, and by being hands on, sets a strong foundation for continued learning. All of our hosts are highly experienced in their craft and supply all the materials you'll need. Discover what you can learn and continue to build on your new skills!_
