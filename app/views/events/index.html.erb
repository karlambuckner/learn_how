We believe learning alongside fellow neighbors creates a sense of community and camaraderie. We find that learning by observation, and by being hands on, sets a strong foundation for continued learning. All of our hosts are highly experienced in their craft and supply all the materials you'll need. Discover what you can learn and continue to build on your new skills!</h5>
